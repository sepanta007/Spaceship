## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).
The goal of the project is to predict which passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were affected by a spacetime anomaly and transported to an alternate dimension.
This project has been recommended based on my participation in [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/sepanta007/Titanic).

## Project Structure

- **sample_submission.csv** : A sample submission file provided by Kaggle to demonstrate the expected format for submissions.
- **my_analysis.ipynb** : Jupyter notebook containing in-depth analysis and exploration of the Spaceship dataset. This notebook covers data exploration, visualizations, and any insights gained from the analysis.
- **predictions.csv** : The file containing the predictions generated by the machine learning model on the test dataset.
- **test.csv** : The test dataset for the competition, used for evaluating the machine learning model.
- **train.csv** : The training dataset for the competition, used for building and training the machine learning model.

## Analysis

The primary analysis is documented in the `my_analysis.ipynb` notebook. Explore this notebook for detailed insights into the dataset, visualizations, and any preprocessing steps taken.

## Predictions

The machine learning model's predictions on the test dataset can be found in the `predictions.csv` file.

## Results

The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of **80.476%** on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting outcomes. Further details about model evaluation metrics.
